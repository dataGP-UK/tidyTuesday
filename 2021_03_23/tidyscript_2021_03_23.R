## no primary key in other data but roll_call$rcid as foreign key
## that links each data base with roll_call

# look at each dataframe to understand variables
## descriptions provided with datasets

# define a question: 
# how did the UK vote on UN resolutions in 2019 compared to the US
# does this indicate any policy differences
# explore differences in voting between Trump & Obama presidencies

# filter roll_call data to 2019 only
