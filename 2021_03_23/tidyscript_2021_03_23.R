# initial observations

## relational databases - explore databases to identify keys

roll_calls %>% count(rcid) %>% 
  filter(n > 1) %>%   # rcid = primary key for roll_calls
  nrow()

## reviewed 3 datasets - roll_call rcid is primary key
## no primary key in other data but roll_call$rcid as foreign key
## that links each data base with roll_call

# look at each dataframe to understand variables
## descriptions provided with datasets

# define a question: 
# how did the UK vote on UN resolutions in 2019 compared to the US
# does this indicate any policy differences
# explore differences in voting between Trump & Obama presidencies

# filter roll_call data to 2019 only

roll1 <- roll_calls %>% 
  filter(date > '2019-01-10')

# initial attempt didn't work as expected

roll1 <- roll_calls %>%
  filter(date >= "2019-01-01" & date <= "2019-12-31") # or

#reviewed - there are only 90 observations - the UN only convenes in dec!

#simplify dates to year only - separate column then select out

roll2 <- roll1 %>% 
  separate(date, 
           into = c('year', 'month_day'),
           sep='-', extra = 'merge') %>% 
  select(c(rcid, year, short))

## table simplified to show rcid, year & details of resolutions only

# next need to join issues with roll2 to categorize resolutions
